An insider who spoke with the outlet claimed that the pair of 25-year-olds were “dancing closely,” while at a New York City nightclub following his show in Madison Square Garden.</p><p>At that point, all of the social media began wondering if Natalia and Muluma had already called it off. Moreover, earlier this week, Maluma and Winnie were spotted having dinner together at a Latin restaurant in Long Island City.</p><p>She later fueled romance rumors on Thursday when she commented under a shirtless picture on the singer’s IG profile.
