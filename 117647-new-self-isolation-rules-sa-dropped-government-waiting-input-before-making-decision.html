This means that people who test positive for <a href=#>Covid-19</a> need to self-isolate and inform people they have recently been in contact with to get tested, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Business Insider </a></i>reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/42945c8a8ab2e0b4.jpg><h2>A global perspective on self-isolation</h2><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sky News</a></i>, the US has started requiring those who have tested positive for Covid-19 and do not show symptoms to only self-isolate for five days and British scientists believe that the UK should follow suit.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoy reading our stories? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a> the BRIEFLY NEWS app on Google Play now and stay up-to-date with major South African news!</strong></p><p class=align-left>Currently, people in the UK who have<a href=#> Covid-19</a> are able to exit their self-isolation after seven days if they produce two consecutive negative PCR tests.</p><p class=align-left>In both the UK and South Africa experts have expressed that they think reducing the self-isolation period will boost the <a href=#>economy</a>, as having people take two weeks off work is not a sustainable practice.</p><h2>An expert opinion on self-isolation</h2><p class=align-left>Rufaro Samanga from the University of the Witwatersrand's Epidemiology & Biostatistics department told <strong>Briefly News</strong> that self-isolation is most effective in a situation where as many positive cases as possible can be identified. However, in South <a href=#>Africa</a>, only 16% of Covid-19 cases are being found in testing.</p>"The reduction from 10 days to 7 days is a combination of mainly two things: growing evidence around the infectious period of a Covid-19 plus individual and health economics (what is Covid-19 costing folks and the broader country when the isolation period is so long). There is growing evidence that supports that people are most infectious in the 2 days prior and 3 days following the onset of symptoms. The reduction to 7 days is thus still erring on the side of caution," Samanga said.<h2>Reactions to proposed self-isolation rule changes</h2><p class=align-left>@douglasrasbash said:</p>"One disease yet so many different rules from so many countries."<p class=align-left>@DeusVuIt shared:</p>"Follow the science, people."<p class=align-left>@IShopshire believes:</p>"May as well say to the virus "Come get us, we give up". This is criminal."<p class=align-left>@WhaleyMark64 said:</p>"As long as the vulnerable are looked after and protected."<p class=align-left>@PaddyStephen1 claims:</p>"At last a bit of common sense - Covid is endemic and we either learn to live with it or this farce goes on for ever - time to grow up and face reality just like we do with seasonal flu."<h2>Omicron: US to end travel ban to South Africa amid easing fears over new variant</h2><p class=align-left>In other Covid-related news, earlier <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that the travel ban imposed on South Africa and other southern African countries is set to be lifted this week after United States (US) <a href=# title>President Joe Biden made a formal announcement</a> on Monday.</p><p class=align-left>The ban was imposed due to fears surrounding the new Omicron Covid-19 variant, the threat of which officials in the country said is understood better, according to a statement released by the White House on Friday.</p><p class=align-left>With the variant now widespread across the globe, travellers from the region will not have a wholly impact on the cases in the US. Biden's proclamation will bring the decision to end the ban into effect at midnight on Friday, 31 December.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKPB0qKlnqujYrKku82opLJnYWaEd4CWZqWer12osq2yjKKqqKSRqbawuoyrrKWdo2LAonnDq6apqJWZeqi71Z6pp6WVo8Fuw8Ciq6Kml2K2r7zUrWSbnZakv6Z5zJqioqaXYrGmr8isoKimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
