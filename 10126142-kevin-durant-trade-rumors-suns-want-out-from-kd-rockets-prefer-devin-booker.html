Smith (h/t <a href=# rel=noopener>NBA Central</a>) said a source told him: "Pay no attention to what Phoenix is saying. They want out of Kevin Durant right now."</p><p>Smith's report came after ESPN NBA insider <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrian Wojnarowski</a> reported that the Houston Rockets wanted to trade for Durant, only for the Suns to tell the Rockets that they are keeping KD for now.</p><p>Per Smith, his source told him that the Rockets want Devin Booker from the Suns rather than Durant since they know they aren't close to championship contention yet, meaning their timeline wouldn't line up with a 35-year-old veteran like Durant.</p><p>Phoenix acquired Durant in a blockbuster trade with the Brooklyn Nets in 2023, sending Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks and a pick swap to Brooklyn.</p><p>The trade has not worked in the Suns' favor thus far, as they were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs in 2023 and the first round this past season.</p><p>Phoenix made another huge trade last offseason, acquiring Bradley Beal from the Washington Wizards. However, the Suns' Big Three couldn't get past the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs.</p><p>Durant was arguably the least of the Suns' issues last season, as he tied Booker for the team lead with 27.1 points per game and also averaged 6.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 three-pointers made and 1.2 blocks while shooting 52.3 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from beyond the arc.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, he stayed healthy and played in 75 regular-season games after not playing more than 55 games in any of the previous four seasons.</p><p>As a 14-time All-Star, four-time scoring champion, two-time NBA champion, two-time NBA Finals MVP, one-time NBA MVP and surefire future Hall of Famer, Durant is one of the all-time greats.</p><p>He also still has plenty of trade value, so if the Suns don't believe they can win a title over the final two years of his contract, trading him would be a sensible move in terms of bringing in a ton of future assets.</p><p>The Rockets are a team in possession of some of those assets, including the Suns' own draft picks.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Wojnarowski</a>, the Rockets traded the Nets back their 2025 and 2026 first-round picks on Tuesday in exchange for the Suns' 2025 and 2027 first-round picks and a 2029 pick swap.</p><p>Those Suns picks were dealt to Brooklyn as part of the Durant trade, and they would be of great value to the Suns if they decide to rebuild and bottom out.</p><p>Booker would perhaps bring the Suns a better package of picks from the Rockets since the four-time All-Star is only 27 years old and is signed through the 2027-28 season, but his age and contract mean the Suns likely aren't in a hurry to trade him.</p><p>There are far bigger diminishing returns on Durant, and holding onto him means Phoenix could risk him getting injured, rendering the organization unable to bring back significant value in a trade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmt%2BdX6MpJyvoZ5isba%2BwKerZqyilrGmedGupKiqo2LAtrrSZq6apqRivLbAjJ%2BpqKVdoLFuvs6cop6so2K9s7HFnqlmnJWrtq95waimpJ2i</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
