The short led to the creation of the Beavis and Butt-Head series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head, who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, Beavis and Butt-Head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.</p><p>In early 1995, after the successful first run of Beavis and Butt-Head on MTV, Mike Judge co-created the show King of the Hill with former The Simpsons writer Greg Daniels. Judge was a former resident of Garland, Texas, upon which the fictional community of Arlen was loosely based, but as Judge stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote the pilot script. Judge voiced characters Hank Hill and Jeff Boomhauer. The show centers on the Hills, a middle-class Methodist family in the small suburban town of Arlen, Texas. It attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. After its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including Entertainment Weekly, Time, and TV Guide.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mike Judge height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Mike <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Judge married his wife Francesca Morocco in 1989, they remained married for twenty years until they divorced in 2009.

During the run of the show, Judge took some time off to write and direct Office Space, Idiocracy, and Extract. As King of the Hill was coming to an end, Judge created his third show, ABC’s The Goode Family, which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After a four-year hiatus, he created his fourth show, the live-action Silicon Valley for HBO, which has received critical acclaim since its premiere. In 2017, Judge’s fourth animated series, the music-themed Tales from the Tour Bus, premiered on Cinemax, to critical and audience acclaim.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Mike Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Director</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Ecuador</strong>. Mike Judge celebrates birthday on October 17 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Judge began to develop one of his four animated short films entitled Milton, about an office drone named Milton that Judge created, which first aired on Liquid Television and Night After Night with Allan Havey, and later aired on Saturday Night Live. The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s, “just in the heart of Silicon Valley and in the middle of that overachiever yuppie thing, it was just awful”. Judge sold the completed film Office Space to 20th Century Fox based on his script and a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Ron Livingston, and David Herman. Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an ensemble cast–based film. The studio suggested he make a movie like Car Wash but “just set in an office”. Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film’s director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, “I had a great crew, and it’s good going into it not pretending you’re an expert.” Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, “More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You’re failing! You’re failing!” In addition, Fox did not like the gangsta rap music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary. In the film, he made a cameo appearance as Stan (complete with hairpiece and fake mustache), the manager of Chotchkie’s, a fictionalized parody of chain restaurants like Chili’s, Applebee’s and TGI Friday’s, and the boss of Jennifer Aniston’s character, whom he continually undermines and interrogates over for her lack of sufficient enthusiasm for the job and the insufficient quantity of “flair” (buttons, ribbons, etc.) she wears on her uniform. The film released on February 19, 1999, and was well received by critics. Although not particularly successful at the box office, it sold well on VHS and DVD, and it has come to be recognized as a cult-classic.</p><h3>What does Mike Judge do now?</h3><p>Judge is <b>steering Beavis and Butt-Head</b> after exiting his longtime overall deal with HBO to focus on the revival in addition to developing a couple of live-action projects. “I’m running some shows that I created, and that’s very much a full, intense thing,” Daniels says.</p><h3>What voices did Mike Judge do?</h3><p>Mike Judge, the creator, <b>provides the voices of the Hank Hill as well as the mumbling ladies’ man Boomhauer</b>.
