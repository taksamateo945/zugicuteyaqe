Dr. Paul Nassif and his wife, Brittany Nassif, threw an impressive party to celebrate daughter Paulina’s first birthday Saturday in Los Angeles. 
“It was absolutely incredible,” said the 59-year-old plastic surgeon and star of E!’s “Botched,” who shared photos from the fête exclusively with Page Six. “Brittany really went all out.” 
The former medical assistant, 30, organized the lavish event herself after a prominent Hollywood party planner bailed on the couple just days ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(The doctor shares Gavin, 18, and 15-year-old twins Christan and Colin with ex-wife Adrienne Maloof.)</p><p>“My boys absolutely adore her. Watching them interact with her makes me feel wonderful,” he said. “Seeing them be so sweet with her has actually made me tear up before. It’s the <a href=#>best part of being a dad</a>.”</p><p>Paul went on to say that he is grateful for the opportunity to <a href=#>raise a child again at this stage in his life</a>.</p><p>“I’ve enjoyed it a lot more because I’m older and more mature compared to when I had my boys,” he said, noting that Paulina’s birth feels “forever ago” but in the best way. “I can’t imagine my life without her. It feels like she’s always been here.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>Paul, Brittany and Paulina pose with Paul’s three teenage sons at the toddler’s birthday party.<span class=credit>Courtesy Nassif family</span></figure><p>If you ask Brittany, though, <a href=#>her first year of motherhood</a> has flown by. “It’s been such a crazy fun ride and it goes by in a flash,” she said. “There are so many milestones and little developments that happen literally every second. As a mom, you want to absorb every single moment and it just feels like there’s never enough time.”&nbsp;</p><p>At 1, Paulina — who enjoys marathon cuddle sessions with mom and gentle forehead nuzzles with dad — is “learning how to walk” and flexing more of her “sassy-pants” personality, Brittany explained.</p><p>“She’s a girl who knows what she wants,” the blogger chuckled. “I can tell you that. She’s a handful but we wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>Paul proudly sported a temporary tattoo of Paulina’s face on his forearm at the party. <span class=credit>Courtesy Nassif family</span></figure><p>According to Brittany and Paul, caring for their “gorgeous” little girl — who they agree “looks more like Paul” — has strengthened their two-year marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>“Having Paulina actually made our relationship even better,” said Brittany, <a href=#>who tied the knot with Paul in October 2019</a>. “I’ve always wanted a part of him for the rest of my life. He’s not going to be around forever, so it just makes me feel better. It makes me feel good knowing that Paulina’s a part of him.”&nbsp;</p><p>For his part, Paul said that witnessing Brittany’s seamless transition into motherhood has made him fall deeper in love with her.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>Brittany and Paul believe having Paulina has made their marriage stronger. <span class=credit>Courtesy Nassif family</span></figure><p>“Watching her become a mother has been amazing. In the beginning, she was worried and scared about being a mom and how she would do, which is normal for any new mother,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>“And then watching her change a diaper like a ninja to putting Paulina to bed all while keeping an incredible schedule, she has turned into an incredible mom and, of course, that just makes me love her more,” he elaborated. “Paulina is so lucky to have a mom like Brittany and this party was a testament to that.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmaPAqrDEZpurZaCWwq15zZqqrKGWYq6vsIywoJ%2BdXZe%2FqsDTmqWyq12avaqvjGqqrWWSnr%2B1tMOasGaokafBunnFqKlmnJGqtKnAxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
