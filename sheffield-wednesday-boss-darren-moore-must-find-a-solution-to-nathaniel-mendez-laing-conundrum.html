Other accused Mendez-Laing of giving away possession cheaply and criticised his lack of end product in the final third.</p><p>Whatever side of the debate you were on, what cannot be argued is that Mendez-Laing featured prominently in the winning goal. He raced on to Barry Bannan’s pass and was blatantly brought down in the box by Scott Kashket. Top-scorer Lee Gregory held his nerve from the penalty spot to seal a third successive home win.</p><p><b>Read more:</b>Sheffield Wednesday discover promotion secret which Rotherham and MK Dons have forgotten</p><p>“I thought he [Mendez-Laing] got stronger and stronger as the game went on,” Moore told Yorkshire Live. “He can feel pleased with his minutes. It was really good to get him going again.</p><p>“He skipped past the defender a couple of times. I was pleased his performance and he can be happy with his contribution to the team.”</p><p>It was the first time Mendez-Laing had started out wide in over two months. Moore has largely been used Mendez-Laing as a centre-forward since the former Cardiff City and Middlesbrough man returned from injury.</p><p>Mendez-Laing is a matchwinner on his day and Moore has tipped him to play a big part in their promotion charge. “He could be a huge asset in terms of what he brings to us,” said Moore. “We know what he can do. We want him to be a threat to the opposition.”</p><p>Many Wednesdayites have called on Moore to stop playing Mendez-Laing up front. It remains to be seen if Mendez-Laing will feature in a central position again this season. Gregory and Saido Berahino have shown signs of developing a partnership in attack. Moore can also call upon forwards Callum Paterson, Florian Kamberi and Sylla Sow.</p><p>With Sam Hutchinson, Lewis Gibson and Harlee Dean nearing full fitness, the Owls will soon be well-stocked at centre-back. Marvin Johnson deputised admirably on the left of the back three against Crewe but he could revert to left wing back for Wednesday’s testing trip to Wycombe Wanderers. Johnson has made the spot his own.</p><p>It leaves Mendez-Laing fighting it out with Jack Hunt to play on the right hand side. Hunt is the man in possession of the jersey and has recently added goals to his game. It will be a tricky call for Moore. Something will have to give.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq5ias6e1xKWbZq%2BVmbumv8OasGaan6jAbrDAq6mepl2ivLC%2BxGakrqukYrOqusNmmGarn6HCtbXOp2Stp12jrrW0wKegnqRdorKvsMSzZKWZmaO0bq%2FOp6ynnKKqunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
