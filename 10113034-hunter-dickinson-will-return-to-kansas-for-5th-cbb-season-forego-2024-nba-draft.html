He was eligible for this fifth collegiate season because of the additional COVID year, and his decision isn't exactly surprising considering he wasn't included in a March mock draft from Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman.
For his part, Dickinson did not publicly announce a decision during a Senior Night speech in front of Jayhawks fans chanting &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I honestly haven't made a decision yet. I'm more kind of letting the season play out.</p><p>"I'm fortunate to have gone through this process where I don't know what I'm going to do for four years now. I'm kind of used to it. I know I definitely won't have a decision before the end of the year because a lot can change from now until the end. Hopefully, if we run the table, win six in a row, (I'll) kind of figure it out after something great like that. That's the plan—waiting, hopefully win a natty, then have a hard decision after that."</p><p>Dickinson was anything but a first-round lock if he did choose to leave given questions about how his defense, athleticism and outside shot will translate to the NBA level.</p><p>Still, he has been nothing if not consistent in the college game.</p><p>He spent his first three seasons with Michigan and helped lead the Big Ten program to an Elite Eight and Sweet 16. He was the 2020-21 Big Ten Rookie of the Year and an All-Big Ten Second Team selection in each of his seasons with the Wolverines.</p><p>In all, he averaged 17.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game while shooting 57 percent from the field for the Maize and Blue.</p><p>Expectations were sky-high surrounding Dickinson when he decided to transfer to powerhouse Kansas following his time at Michigan, and he delivered. He was <a href=# rel=noopener>named</a> a member of the All-Big 12 First Team alongside teammate Kevin McCullar Jr. and took home the conference's Newcomer of the Year award.</p><p>The recognition came as he averaged 17.9 points, 10.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game as a double-double machine.</p><p>Playing at Kansas also gave him quite the spotlight going into March Madness, and he responded with a double-double of 19 points and 20 rebounds in a win over Samford and 15 points in the second-round loss to Gonzaga.</p><p>Now he will look to build on that success during a second season with the Jayhawks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWh9dICMoaynrJWneqW1wqSgp6ufo3q4tculZKudpKq%2Fr3nTqGSkmZ6orrR5xaipZm2knXqkrsFmqp6Zo6S7brLOq5ygp11nfXOAjKeZmmWUp66nwA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
