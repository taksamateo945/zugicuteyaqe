‘What a journey ♥️ I’ve come along way. 6 months postpartum and no matter how bad they want my results to be from surgery ( even during a pandemic 🤔😂) Breastfeeding, eating clean and working my ass off everyday really paid off. It was never about snapping back because, honestly I’m ready to get pregnant again 🥰🤫’ Erica captioned her post."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not giving up and really pushing myself. The woman’s body and mind is seriously the strongest of it all. I documented EVERYTHING for you, ladies. The crying because I felt I couldn’t. The pushing through because I know I could. I want to share my fitness journey with you all. You will see the workouts from the beginning. Once my doctor gave me the go ahead I went beast mode. I want you all you join me. Let’s inspire each other. September 1st it will begin. More information coming soon. In the meantime get your mind, body, and soul ready to challenge yourself. All to be a better YOU! ( March 2020 – July 2020 results).’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CD36NOoJyco/</p><p>A follower said: ‘I remember you starting out before us and was still going when we were done…I’m like damn…Erica beasting over there….💪🏿💪🏿’</p><p>Someone said: ‘So you gone drop the workout and diet for us or naw?
