He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager.</p><p>Iconic guitarist whose 1967 psychedelic rock album Are You Experienced earned seven Grammy Awards and is widely considered to be one of the best rock albums of all time.
