He's just going to have to wait on it a bit longer.</p><p>NBA insider <a href=# rel=noopener>Marc Stein</a> reported the Philadelphia 76ers plan to "swiftly" re-sign Maxey once they have used their cap space in free agency.</p><p>The Sixers are slated to have max-level room but will need to time their new signings in a certain order to make the deals work under the cap. Maxey has a cap hold of just $13 million, so holding out and waiting to use their space was always the plan. While a team could attempt to foil that plan by offering Maxey an offer sheet, there's no chance he signs it given the Sixers can offer him the most long-term security.</p><p>Both the team and Maxey have both been open about following this plan since before the start of last season.</p><p>"At the end of the day, like I said, it's a competition," Maxey <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> before the start of the 2023-24 season. "We have one goal in mind and I love Philly. I know this is the business. I know this is how it goes and I'm a happy person. This is my life. I'm happy with it."</p><p>While he had to be patient in waiting for his nine-figure payday, Maxey likely made himself some money along the way. He solidified himself into a max-contract player last season, averaging 25.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 6.2 assists on his way to making his first All-Star team and winning Most Improved Player.</p><p>The Sixers are expected to be aggressive early in the free-agency period, with Los Angeles Clippers All-Star Paul George among their top targets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuDeIKMcG2eqqNiv7a5zquqZqypp7K0sYymmLGdqWLBsHnSop6nZZOku7W%2BwJyrZpmWqbKzedKao5qqqWKworyMrqqenF2ku266wZpkn6qVmnqis8Snq6w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
