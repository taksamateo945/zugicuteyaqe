She better be taking that pic for her album cover 😂Majesty is so big now. ❤️❤️❤️.”</p><p>This fan asked if Rihanna is having baby number one with Hassan Jameel: “Why do I feel like she’s pregnant? Swear kids are the best photographers! 😂. This is why I need one 😂😂There’s nothing like a loving relationship with your aunt, who sometimes, is like your second mom. Love it.”</p><p>This music lover responded: “She was showing her whole stomach when she was in Barbados lately, and she’s not in Barbados NOW, she’s in London & Paris to prepare for the launch of her OWN luxury fashion house “Fenty” which is debuting this week. Also, that’s why she’ve been lowkey lately and not attending any events including Met Gala. Make it make sense tf. Stop the Fenty Photos and give us that Fenty album! Damn sis can’t wear an oversized dress without being pregnant. 😒”</p><p>A fourth comment read: “These “where is the album” comments getting annoying now… you’ll get it when she wants. If Rihanna wanted you all to know she was pregnant-she would announce it…YALL BE WORRIED ABOUT THE WRONG THINGS! I think her dress is cute tho😍Y’all ain’t never getting new music ….she is a beauty and fashion mogul now 🤷🏽‍♀️❤️😂😂😂 Let sis live her life and secure the bag.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Rihanna is making some big money moves and she is only rivaled by kylie Jenner and her billion-dollar empire.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinrWius2aZKyokae4tHnPq5ygppGjsLp50a6kqKpdrLa1tIysrqKml2Kxs7HSrGSipl2YwrWxjK%2BgnZ2fYsSpsdGeZKGdomK7qrHCnmSmmZqawLXFjKKqZqyRoLavs4yaZKmhk6nCs7GMoqpmq5iaeq6tyqKloGWSnrRuvMuapaxlp57BqXnHmqqsmZ5it6K5xJ6jZmpoZ4B3hI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
