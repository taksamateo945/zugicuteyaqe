She had admitted to Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) that she had indeed been stalking Anna and was responsible for the vandalism that occurred. But she insisted that she did not burn Anna’s house down, and no one believes she could have used a high-powered sniper rifle. After looking through some old WSB files, Anna theorized that an old agent named Jameson Forsythe was her stalker. However, Valentin put the kibosh on that theory when he informed her he’d seen Charlotte sneaking into her hotel room on the Metro Court Hotel’s security footage.</p><p dir=ltr>While Anna reels from the fact that she shot Charlotte thinking she was Forsythe, it’s taken the spotlight off this mysterious past enemy. But it’s highly likely he was behind the sniper shooting and arson. If so, he could be working with Cyrus Renault, who’s been revealed to be the head of a mysterious criminal organization bent on taking Sonny Corinthos down, and the two might attempt to kill two birds with one stone.</p><p dir=ltr>Celeb Dirty Laundry also revealed that Ava Jerome (Maura West) is going to be questioned by both Sonny and Dante Falconeri regarding Austin’s murder. Austin was a puppet who had been blackmailed into doing Cyrus’ bidding, and the truth behind this enigmatic crime syndicate may come to light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6ton5WjsrOty2afqKugnsGiuIysp6ihnJq%2FtHnHmq2eZaWoeqK606KaoqiRqbavs4yep6KbXZeutcDLnmSipl2lvLPAjJyfmqqcmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
