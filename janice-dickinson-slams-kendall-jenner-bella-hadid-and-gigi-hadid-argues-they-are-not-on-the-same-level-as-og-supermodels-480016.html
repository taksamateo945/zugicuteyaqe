There is no doubt that nowadays, the Hadid sisters are two of the most well known faces on the runway but Dickinson is not impressed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Janice Dickinson does not think that Gigi and Bella Hadid, or Kendall Jenner, have what it takes to be compared to OG supermodels!</p><p>There is no doubt that nowadays, the Hadid sisters are two of the most well known faces on the runway but Dickinson is not impressed.</p><p>While on the Behind The Velvet Rope podcast, Janice told David Yontef all about her opinion on the modelling scene today, holding nothing back!</p><p>It all started with the OG being asked about Gigi as well as Kendall Jenner – are they good or not?</p><p>Well, Janice was quick to reply that ‘No. They are not. They have one look. They do not really diversify their movements. They stand there and get paid millions of dollars.’</p><p>She went on to explain that ‘The models of the ‘70s, ‘80s don’t compare to the models of today, the Instagram models who get famous and they get put into Vogue—all the Kylie Jenners, the Gigi Hadids and the Bella Hadids. They are very pretty women, but they aren’t supermodels, I am sorry. They have millions and millions and millions of followers. And you know, Vogue has a subscription of what 800,000 and Kylie Jenner has like, what, 25 million following her? Something like that.’</p><p>Well, the 66 year old former supermodel was only about 194 million or so off but she is not really a supermodel anyway.</p><p></p><p>Her sister, Kendall, however, has walked many prestigious fashion shows and she boasts an impressive 154 million Instagram followers. Just FYI.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Janice was not done dragging them, adding that ‘They were never on the level of all the girls from the ‘70s and ‘80s and the ‘90s. We were fabulous. They are not fierce walkers, are you kidding me? Back in the day, there was Pat Cleveland and Iman, who you just never wanted to follow on the runway. Not like Pat Cleveland who’s just a feat, she was like a surfer down the runway. She was fantastic… She knew how to take a gown and make it work. You work the fabric, work the clothes. These models today do not know how to do that.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealruqr8Rmm6Kbm567tLvNZqqlmZ2oeqyxzZ2YpaRdn7KvusSrZJudnKGubrTAnaCdZZGjsW6zyKCgZqCRmbalecCrnq6do2LBqbHYZpirnV2jvLV5zqdkraCVYsCiucRmo56ulaF6or%2BMqJ5mq6WlsrO5zp2cpatdaYVxfJBvZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
