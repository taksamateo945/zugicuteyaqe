John Krasinski worked as a waiter</strong></p><p>John Krasinski waited tables before he got his breakthrough role in The Office. Like many struggling actors trying their luck in the Hollywood industry, John worked as a waiter to make ends meet. He later described his job experience as “the worst.”</p><p><strong>2. John had a deal with his mother to start teaching English if he couldn’t live off acting.</strong></p><p>Yes, it indeed is true! John was almost ready to give up on his dream of becoming an actor. However, his mother asked him to hold on a little longer. As a mother, she didn’t want her son to give up. Will you believe John got the role in The Office just three weeks after that? So, if it weren’t for his mother, the talented actor would never be where he is today. Mothers are mothers, after all. They know what is best for you, always!</p><p><strong>3. He went to high school with the writer and executive producer of The Office, B.J Novak</strong></p><p>John Krasinski and B.J Novak worked together even before The Office. The duo went to Newton South High School together. Not only did they study together, but they also began their acting career together! In fact, John acted in a satirical play by B.J Novak during their senior years. So, John feels that Novak’s influence encouraged him to follow an acting career. As he put in an interview, “The way I tell it, I feel like I owe him a percentage of everything I’ve done since.”</p><p><strong>4. John Krasinski taught English at a high school.</strong></p><p>John Krasinski worked as an English teacher at a local high school in Costa Rica. It was soon after he passed out of high school and hadn’t even joined college.</p><p><strong>5. He lost significant weight for one of his movies</strong></p><p>Can you believe that John lost 17% of his body fat for his role in the film 13 Hours? Talk about dedication; he dropped his body fat from 25 to 17%</p><p><strong>6. John</strong> <strong>almost became Captain America.</strong></p><p>We don’t know if John regrets this. But we know he had auditioned for the role of Captain America. He even reached the custom rehearsal round. Then what went wrong? Just that John saw Chris Hemsworth in the screen test. Then, he decided he stood no chance! Who knew if he could’ve been Captain America? Not that we don’t love Chris Evans, though!</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_7eaeb1-e2 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_7eaeb1-e2>Childhood</h2><p>On October 20, 1979, John Krasinski was born at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
