Dan Graziano of ESPN reported the Giants' favorite quarterback in the 2024 class is North Carolina's Drake Maye, but they could target Washington's Michael Penix Jr. if they're unable to land Maye—perhaps as high as No. 6 overall.
Reports the Giants favor Michigan's J.J. McCarthy, by contrast, are reportedly no longer true."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

McCarthy</a>, by contrast, are reportedly no longer true.</p><p>The Giants are one of several teams drafting high Thursday night that could target a quarterback. However, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dianna Russini</a> of The Athletic reported the Giants are unlikely to trade up to take a quarterback after signing Daniel Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract last offseason.</p><p>Giants general manager Joe Schoen has also said the team is satisfied with its quarterback room after adding Drew Lock this offseason.</p><p>"I don't think so," Schoen <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> when asked if the team needs a quarterback. "I think with Drew's experience, he has started games and played, and Daniel's experience. And what Tommy [DeVito] did last year, another year in the system, Tommy's come a long way. No, I think we could go into the season with the three that we have and be comfortable with that."</p><p>While Jones' contract is considered by most to be a sunk cost already, the amount of draft capital the Giants would need to give up to move up would be considerable. That will likely take them out of the running for Maye, who is a strong candidate to be taken within the first three picks.</p><p>Taking Penix at No. 6 would be nothing short of a seismic reach. The <a href=#>B/R Scouting Department</a> has the Washington product ranked as the No. 89 overall player in the 2024 class, the equivalent of a third-round grade. While quarterbacks are always drafted at a premium, it's hard to imagine Penix flying this far up the draft board.</p><p>The Giants selected Jones higher than most expected at No. 6 in the 2019 draft. However, that was a different regime, and Schoen seems willing to be more patient at the position.</p><p>The latest <a href=#>B/R mock</a> draft has Penix dropping to the Giants at pick No. 70.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2AcYGMp52lZaKqurC%2B0maeopmeqcBuucCyZJ2qkZvBbrnInJ%2BanZxivaa6yLFko6pdlsFugoyapKKcXZm%2ForfEZqSasZViuqSvwKurobFdl8K7xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
