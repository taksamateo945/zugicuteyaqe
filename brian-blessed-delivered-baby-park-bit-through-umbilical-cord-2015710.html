British actor Brian Blessed, who has had roles in hit films like Star Wars: Episode I, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and Alexander, told an interesting (and slightly unsettling) tale during a recent BBC Radio 4 interview. 
Apparently back in 1963, the now-thickly bearded actor helped deliver a baby girl in a park in London. 
“Years ago, I was running all over Richmond Park and a woman was having a baby under a tree,” he told the incredulous radio hosts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I had kind of grown up with babies, a working-class background, and helping with babies. I rushed to her and got her legs open.”&nbsp;</p><p>Blessed, now 78, went on to explain how he helped deliver the child, right there in the middle of the park.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Gradually I got the baby out. Yes, I delivered [the baby] in Richmond Park,” he continued. “And the afterbirth came out. I got rid of the clots, and I got the afterbirth out. Then I bit it loose and tied [the umbilical cord] into a knot, etc. Then I just called for help. I was covered in blood, my shirt was covered in blood. I was licking the baby’s face. I never talked about it before.”&nbsp;</p><p>One of the radio hosts said, “If this extraordinary story is true, I can think of few less restful things than having Brian Blessed attend my birth in a park.”&nbsp;</p><p>Is it safe to say the baby was #Blessed?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmroZGjeqO4xKyqnpxdmbKttdWeqZ6cXZeuo8WMqZiro12XtrV506GpqK2XnXq2ucGio6KbkaF6pLvRnWRraGFqhHJ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
