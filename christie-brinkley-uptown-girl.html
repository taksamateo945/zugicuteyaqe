The couple, who wed in 1985 and divorced in 1994 citing irreconcilable differences as their reason for divorce, have been known to spend some time together over the years. Of course, it’s a great decision considering the couple have a 29-year-old daughter together.</p><p>Their good relationship has always been apparent to the press, as it was this weekend in Madison Square Garden. After Joel was named a franchise by Madison Square Garden, it was announced he’d perform once a month at the venue until people are no longer interested in seeing him perform. This weekend was once of those performances, and his ex-wife had front row seats to the concert.</p><p>It’s no big secret to anyone that Brinkley was the star of the 1983 video for Joel’s “Uptown Girl,” and when the song began to play at Thursday’s concert, he directed cameras to the front row to film Brinkley dancing to the song while he sang to her. The supermodel posted a couple of photos to her Instagram account during the performance, including one of her daughter, Sailor, from her most recent marriage, filming the singer from her own front row seat. She also posted a photo of herself at the concert with the caption, “he’s still got it,”.</p><p>The video is one of the most famous videos of all time. Filming Brinkley dancing to the song from the video in which she appeared 31 years ago was a fun moment for everyone at the concert. It’s also apparent that Brinkley is aging well, as she looks just as amazing now – at 60- as she did back then when she was still in her 20s!</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqsYybqaKmm6GyunnUqauor55itKq%2By2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
