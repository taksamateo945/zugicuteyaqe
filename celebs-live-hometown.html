And for those that do, it makes sense: they are the undisputed hubs of the entertainment industry in the U.S. But for some stars, the siren song of nightly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>red carpets</a> and Beverly Hills infinity pools doesn't quite do the trick. Instead, something a bit more humble has appeal. More celebrities than you think still live in their hometown.</p><p>Whether they moved back after scoring big or simply never left in the first place, a select crop of famous folks live right in the places where they grew up (albeit in way fancier digs). We're talking places like Kentwood, Louisiana; Leiper's Fork, Tennessee; and Yellow Springs, Ohio—all towns far removed from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. So read on—you just might find that your favorite celeb lives right next door.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The 14 Celebrities Who Have the Most Kids</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Bruce-Springsteen.jpg><p>Few stars are as heavily associated with their home state as&nbsp;<strong>Bruce Springsteen&nbsp;</strong>is with New Jersey. The Boss grew up in Freehold, NJ, and as most of his music will tell you, he was never likely to roam too far. He and his wife <strong>Patty Scialfa&nbsp;</strong>reside <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on a horse farm in Colts Neck</a>, which is in the same county as the house where the star grew up. And investing in horses definitely paid off—their daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Jessica Springsteen</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>an Olympic equestrian</a> who competed in the last Olympic games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/shutterstock_103572509.jpg><p>Born in New Orleans, <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong> was raised in Nashville, Tennessee by her physician parents. When it came time to spend some of her hard-earned acting money on real estate, she went back to her roots—purchasing <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>three homes in the Nashville</a> area with her husband, Jim Toth. Currently, they split their time between there and another mansion in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/JustinTimberlake.jpg><p>After years in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> moved back to his roots in 2016, purchasing a home in Tennessee and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>naming it "Millville"</a> in honor of his childhood suburb of Millington, Tennessee. Despite its humble location, the abode also serves as the creative HQ for the artist's clothing line and artist development company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Ludacris.jpg><p>Rapper and&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Ludacris&nbsp;</strong>has called a lot of places home. He was born in Champaign, Illinois, then spent parts of his childhood in Chicago and Virginia. For his last years of high school, his family was in Atlanta, Georgia, and the star ended up going to college and beginning to make music there too. As an adult, Ludacris has chosen to put down roots where he spent some of his most formative years and lives on a 22-acre estate in Atlanta. And if it's difficult to conceptualize just how big that is, consider that Ludacris said during a recent appearance on Ellen&nbsp;that he hadn't even&nbsp;seen&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>certain parts of his home</a> until he was stuck there during lockdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/dave-chappelle.jpg><p><strong>Dave Chappelle</strong> grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., but he often spent summers in the sleepy town of Yellow Springs, Ohio, and went to middle school there, too. <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>His father was a professor</a> at the nearby Antioch University. As an adult, the comedian moved back to town, purchasing a farm there as a refuge from the hectic Hollywood lifestyle. He's even been doing <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>regular comedy shows</a> there for a local audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/zach-galifianakis-celebrity-weight-loss-stories.jpg><p>The actor-comedian grew up in Alleghany County, North Carolina, and has since purchased a large farm there, where he spends his time. (He's not shy about giving <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>tours to the media</a>, by the way.) Eventually, he hopes to turn the estate into a writer's retreat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/LeBron-James.jpg><p>Though the basketball star now plays in Los Angeles, <strong>LeBron James</strong> still maintains a home in his childhood town of Akron, Ohio. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>30,000 square foot compound</a> allegedly houses a recording studio, a bowling alley, a casino, and a barbershop, among other ultra-luxe perks and amenities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/media/images/ext/403948490/warren-buffett.jpg><p>Despite being one of the wealthiest men on earth, the investment mogul <strong>Warren Buffett </strong>still resides in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. His home, meanwhile, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>purchased in 1958</a> for around $250,000 in today's dollars. It's just one of the reasons Buffett remains one of the most beloved—and relatable—billionaires on earth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/shutterstock_155475521.jpg alt="Jeff Daniels Small Town Celebrities" width=1024 height=682 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Renowned actor <strong>Jeff Daniels </strong>resides with his wife and three children in his hometown of Chelsea, Michigan.

In addition to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>giving back</a> extensively to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>local causes</a>, the rapper has also mused about <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>running for mayor</a>. After then-mayor <strong>Rahm Emanuel</strong>'s surprise announcement in 2018 that he would not be seeking re-election, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Chance tweeted</a> "thinkin maybe I should," referencing a lyric of his in which he considers his own chances with voters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Chance-the-Rapper.jpg><p>At the age of 12, <strong>Usher</strong> and his family relocated from Tennessee to Atlanta, Georgia. Soon afterwards, the singer got his big break, earning a recording contract at the age of 14. Despite earning enough money to live anywhere he pleases, Usher remained in Atlanta. In 2018, he <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>sold his then-home</a> after reports of a stalker surfaced, so hopefully the location of his current mansion stays more private.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Usher.jpg><p><strong>Drake&nbsp;</strong>was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, and he's stayed true to his Canadian roots.

After becoming a movie star, though, the actor decided to remain right where he was, purchasing his own apartment in the city.

The actor's notoriety caused a stir in his hometown in 2011, mostly due to the strange objects the actor would leave on his doorstep, which ultimately resulted in a neighbor running a now-defunct blog, "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>What's On Steve Buscemi's Stoop?</a>"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/shutterstock_44970370.jpg><p>The man behind Seinfeld's J.
