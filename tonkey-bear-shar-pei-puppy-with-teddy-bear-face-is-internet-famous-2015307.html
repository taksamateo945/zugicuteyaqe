The 4-month-old pooch has more than 165,000-plus followers on Instagram, and has made headlines for her angelic face, tiny paws, heart-shaped button nose, pale green eyes, and of course, that fuzzy little bear coat.
Tonkey Bear's lucky owner, Christine Park, wrote a post on Bored Panda about her sweet Shar-Pei puppy's meteoric rise to fame."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Meet<strong> Tonkey Bear</strong>, a Shar-Pei puppy with the face of a teddy bear, who is the Internet's newest obsession.</p><p>The 4-month-old pooch has more than 165,000-plus followers <a href=#>on Instagram</a>, and has made headlines for her angelic face, tiny paws, heart-shaped button nose, pale green eyes, and of course, that fuzzy little bear coat.</p><p>Tonkey Bear's lucky owner, <strong>Christine Park</strong>, wrote a post on <a href=#>Bored Panda</a> about her sweet Shar-Pei puppy's meteoric rise to fame. "8 weeks ago I created Tonkey her own Instagram account for the sole purpose of making friends myself," she wrote. "The way it was supposed to go down: post photo of cute dog, cute dog attracts good-looking friends, good-looking friends want to hang out with me."</p><p>Tonkey Bear has indeed attracted some new friends — and she's a natural in front of the camera, too. "Werkin it to work," one post on the account read last month.</p><p>She's also very well behaved.</p><p>According to Park, Tonkey Bear is 100 percent Shar-Pei, although some may argue that she's part bear. The pooch lives in Edmonton, Alberta, and has a big sister named <strong>Maxi,</strong> who was a rescue pup. Naturally, Tonkey and Max are besties.</p><p>"Max, Tonkey, and Tonkey's mouth towel," the account posted on Thursday, July 29, alongside a sweet snap of the puppies.</p><p>Tonkey is popular among other puppy pals, too.</p><p>Park spoke to <a href=#>Mashable</a> about Tonkey Bear's fame on Thursday, July 29, saying some have apparently accused her of "messing around" with the Shar-Pei breed and have called Tonkey a "designer dog." She takes the haters in stride, though.</p><p>Park sought out a Shar-Pei after becoming familiar with the breed's history. Shar-Peis, which originate from China, nearly went extinct in the '70s due to mass extermination. The name is translated into "sand skin," since Shar-Peis are known for their distinctive, rough, but adorable wrinkly coats.</p><p>"We knew this breed was special," Park told Mashable. "And it was decided Maxi's future bestie would be a Shar-Pei."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuoppuaxm6uxJqpZquYlr9uvMSiZKmtoKXGbsPIrZ9mrJWZsbp5wZ6Yq2WWlrCmecisZKKmpJq%2Fr7HTZp2apZ%2BqwG5%2Bj2psbGhn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
