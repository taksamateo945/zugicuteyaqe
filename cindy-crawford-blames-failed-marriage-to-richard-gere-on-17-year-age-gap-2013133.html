The model spoke candidly about their short-lived union during the March 11 episode of Oprah's Master Class, citing their 17-year age difference as the biggest issue in their relationship.</p><p>The stars met during a star-studded barbecue at the late photographer <strong>Herb Ritts</strong>' home. "There were a lot of really cool people there. I was like, 'Wow! <strong>Jack Nicholson</strong>!'" Crawford recalled. "I was 21. It was still all new to me. I met Richard Gere there. We pretty much started dating right away. When I was with him, that's when I was becoming well-known as well."</p><p>The stars married four years later when Crawford was 25 and Gere was 42; they divorced in 1995.</p><p>"I just think your twenties, for women, is such a time when you're starting to come into your own and feel your own power and connect to your inner strength, and it's hard to do that — it's hard to change — in a relationship, because what one person might have signed up for, all of a sudden, you're not that anymore," the model said. "I think I was more willing at 22 to be, like, 'Okay, I'll follow,' but then you start going, 'Well, I don't want to just follow — I want to lead sometimes and I want to walk side by side sometimes.'"</p><p>During their time together, Gere — who had starred in hit films like Pretty Woman, An Officer and a Gentleman and American Gigolo — showed Crawford how to deal with fame.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Love lives of models</a></p><p>"When I would see how he was with fans when they approached him, a lot of the times it wouldn't be a good moment to sign an autograph, shake a hand or sign a picture. But I got to look to him to see how he created boundaries for himself that felt good," Crawford said. "Being a nice girl fro the Midwest, my inclination is always to give and say yes because I want people to like me. But then I saw Richard do it in a way that was like, 'You know what? Sorry, I'm not doing that. But I see you. He felt it was really just about making that connection, looking someone in the eyes and making sure that they felt seen."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Crawford was the first to remarry, tying the knot with restaurateur <strong>Rande Gerber</strong> in 1998. The two are parents to son <strong>Presley</strong>, 13, and daughter <strong>Kaia</strong>, 11. Gere married model and actress <strong>Carey</strong> <strong>Lowell</strong> in 2002, two years after welcoming son <strong>Homer</strong>.</p><p>Though her marriage to Gere didn't work out, Crawford doesn't view it as a complete failure. "Richard's a super smart guy, and he's interesting, and he's interested, and I learned a lot about the world," she explained. "It was a great chapter in my life."</p><p>Oprah's Master Class airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on OWN.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqippSueqS%2BwLCdqKqUYq%2BtrcyeqmaekZ65prCMppirqpmWtKZ506hkq6GTna6zsIygnKudXaS7bn2WZrCemaJirqixjKCYqWViZX50fZJs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
