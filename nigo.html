The painting was sold in 2019 for $14.8 million at Sotheby’s in Hong Kong among other artworks. The total of the sales of his art collection was $28 million.</p><p>Nigo’s venture into fashion started in a small store selling a few Bape T-shirts and camouflage print hoodies, which became very popular among teenagers. In 2002, Nigo released the Bapesta sneaker, which according to BBC presenter Jonathan Ross, later became the “epitome of collectable footwear.” The sneaker resembles Nike’s Air Force 1 design, but instead of the swoosh on the side, it has Nigo’s Bapesta logo that is a star with a lightning zap extending out of the star. In 2005, Nigo partnered with Pharrell Williams to create and launch the streetwear brands Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream footwear. In 2014, Nigo became the creative director for Uniqlo’s UT brand and his new brand Human Made.</p><p align=justify>The man is originally of Maebashi, Japan.</p><p>Together with BiS manager Watanabe Junnosuke, Nigo is the producer and manager for the female pop group BILLIE IDLE. His involvement with the group began in 2014, when he directed a music video for BiS’ song “nerve”, and after the group disbanded, Nigo and Watanabe offered BiS members First Summer Uika and Hirano Nozomi the chance to join their new project, BILLIE IDLE. The group debuted in 2014 with the album “IDLE GOSSIP”, for which Nigo is the executive producer.</p><h3>Does Nigo still own BAPE?</h3><p>Nigo also founded the secondary lines AAPE (by A Bathing Ape) and BAPY (Busy Working Lady). In 2011, the company was sold to Hong Kong fashion conglomerate I.T Group for about $2.8 Million. <b>Nigo left the brand in 2013</b>.</p><h3>Why did Nigo left BAPE?</h3><p>Nigo admits he chose to leave the brand, not because of where the brand was headed, but <b>to pursue his own future</b>. “It was about six months ago that I started to think about what I wanted to do next. I guess it’s just me being selfish,” Nigo told the publication.</p><h3>What is Human Made Nigo?</h3><p>Human Made is <b>a Japanese fashion label</b>, founded by fashion designer and music producer/DJ NIGO, in 2010. NIGO started up this brand in order to create things he was not able to with his revolutionary, trendsetting streetwear brand – A Bathing Ape (BAPE).</p><h3>How old is Nigo?</h3><p>51 years (December 23, 1970)</p><h3>Is Nigo still the creative director of Uniqlo?</h3><p><b>Nigo served as the Creative Director of the brand until 2013</b>, following I.T Limited’s 2011 acquiring of the brand after buying 90 percent of Nowhere Inc. —BAPE’s mother company. He also created the brand Human Made in 2010 and later joined Uniqlo and Creative Director of its UT collection.</p><p>You may read full biography about Nigo from Wikipedia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfo7aou44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
