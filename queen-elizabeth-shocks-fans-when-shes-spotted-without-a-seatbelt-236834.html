Witnesses at the scene said to the publication the vehicle flipped over and Philip was clearly nervous and shocked.</p><p>There was a 28-year-old woman driving the other vehicle along with her 45-year-old passenger and a baby in the back. Both were treated for cuts on the knee as well as broken wrist, respectively. They were taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsF4f2IHosg/</p><p>Both women were let out of the hospital, while the 9-month-old baby boy was thankfully not injured. The Queen is actually the only person allowed to drive without a license, and she first learned while helping out in the Second World War efforts.</p><p>Previously, Dickie Arbiter, her ex-press secretary said to reporters from Us Weekly that she definitely has a “heavy right foot,” but overall, she’s quite a “safe and cautious” driver. Arbiter went on to say that the Queen would never tell her husband to quit driving. She wouldn’t even suggest something like that.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>On Friday, Princess Anne became a bit irritated when reporters asked her about her father’s accident and how it left his health. The royal family member said she had “no idea.” The 68-year-old said to the press that she was in the same position as all the rest.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGehqrKmuoyeo6KykZeytbSMrJ%2Bom5uoeqetzaxksKCVo3q0tMSsZKyon6nBprCMsKCtoJ%2BqwW6tjKycmqySmrm1eZFsbXFrZGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
