Legendary groupie Albritton was a young art student at the University of Illinois Chicago when she got the idea for her lifelong art project. Her teacher assigned a plaster casting project, and she had already been dreaming of ways to meet rock musicians – and, she hoped, lose her virginity to one. She practiced her concept on a couple of her friends, then made her way back stage at a Jimi Hendrix (1942–1970) concert."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her teacher assigned a plaster casting project, and she had already been dreaming of ways to meet rock musicians – and, she hoped, lose her virginity to one. She practiced her concept on a couple of her friends, then made her way back stage at a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimi Hendrix (1942–1970)</a> concert. Hendrix agreed to be her first celebrity client, later followed by artists including Wayne Kramer of MC5, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zal Yanovsky (1944–2002)</a> of the Lovin’ Spoonful, and Tony Stevens of Foghat. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Zappa (1940–1993)</a> took an interest in Albritton’s work and helped her move from Chicago to Los Angeles, where she became one of the legendary groupies of the late 1960s. Albritton took a break from casting after 1971, later returning to cast the penises of artists such as Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys and Richard Lloyd of Television. In later years, she added filmmakers and other artists to her repertoire, and she began casting the breasts of women artists, including Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, in the interest of equality. Albritton’s work was immortalized in songs including “Plaster Caster” by KISS and “Five Short Minutes” by Jim Croce.</p><h2><strong>Albritton on attempting to work with the Monkees</strong></h2><p>“I tried to cast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter [Tork]</a> during the time I had discovered dental mold and I didn’t know how to use it. Just as I was opening the can – it was like an old-fashioned Planters’ Peanut type can – I cut my finger on the edge and cut it so bad it wouldn’t stop bleeding and Mickey Dolenz had to tourniquet my middle finger. I should probably have gone to the hospital, but it all went well with the finger. No cast of Peter, though.” —source</p><h2 id=h-tributes-to-cynthia-albritton><strong>Tributes to Cynthia Albritton</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Deeply saddened to report the passing of Cynthia Albritton (a.k.a., Cynthia Plaster Caster) today. Cynthia was infamously known for making plaster casts of male rock stars’ penises in the 1960s and ’70s, and very nearly casted Peter Tork, until Fate intervened.
