That all changed when the two came face-to-face while taping the Bachelorette: Men Tell All special (airing July 16 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC).</p><p>“That meeting between Emily and Kalon, that was the first time she had seen him since she told him to leave,” host <strong>Chris Harrison</strong>, 40, told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the ESPY Awards in L.A. July 11. “I just wasn’t expecting his reaction, her reaction. It’s very good.”</p><p>(When Maynard, 26, sent McMahon, 27, packing in Episode 5, she seethed: “I want to go out there and rip his limbs off and beat him with them. I will never as long as I live let anyone speak ill of Ricki or any other kids I may have or husband I may have. I want to go West Virginia, hood rat, backwoods on his ass. That’s how much I love my daughter.”)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Though Harrison couldn’t say much else about Maynard and McMahon’s confrontation, he did promise more must-see moments from other jilted lovers. “I think the biggest drama — and I wasn’t expecting it — was the emotion out of <strong>Chris</strong> [<strong>Bukowski</strong>] and <strong>Sean</strong> [<strong>Lowe</strong>] seeing Emily again,” he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though viewers won’t know if Maynard chooses race car driver <strong>Arie Luyendyk</strong>, <strong>Jr</strong>., 30, or entrepreneur <strong>Jef Holm</strong>, 27, until the July 22 finale, Harrison told <strong>Us he</strong>‘s “happy with how it all turned out for her.”</p><p>“I think she handled herself just excellent the entire way through. I love how she spoke her mind like a normal woman would in a lot of situations, whether it was telling Kalon to get the f–k out, or crying like she did when saying goodbye to Sean . . . I love the way she acted the entire season.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWVoratxYymmKeZopl6pLvNn6mopqSoeqyty6ilZqWToq6pu81mpqdlnZq7bsDEpaNmmZyherS8xJygmqRdZ31yfpBrbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
