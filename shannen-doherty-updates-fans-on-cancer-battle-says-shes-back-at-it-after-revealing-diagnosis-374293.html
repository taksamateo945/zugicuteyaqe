The 48-year-old actress posted a series of pics on Instagram to show how she is living as healthy as possible while she battles the disease.</p><p>“After a year of dealing with cancer coming back and other stresses, I’m back at it,” Doherty wrote in the caption. “Taking care of myself and embracing every day. It’s not always easy. I have days I’m depressed or just plain lazy. But I push thru with the help of friends.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9KxqqOBCjB/</p><p>Doherty added that her friend Anne Marie Kortright had been “relentless” in getting her to go out for a hike, and for her learning new ways to cook that not only feed her soul, but also her tummy in “a very healthy way.”</p><p>The actress also called out her fitness trainer Kiara Stokes for kicking her butt the day before. Doherty declared it had been a “productive great week,” that has led her to feeling better, adding that her skin is alive and so is she.</p><p>One of the pics featured Doherty with Kortright and Stokes. The others featured healthy recipes from Malibu Rad Kitchen, which Doherty credited as making cooking “fun, healthy, and sustainable.”</p><p>Doherty revealed last month on Good Morning America that her breast cancer was back. Her first cancer battle ended with her going into remission in 2017. However, she found out last year that it had returned.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9PpJYqBSW3/</p><p>The Charmed star explained that it was a bitter pill to swallow in a lot of ways, and she hadn’t processed it yet. Doherty also admitted that she wasn’t posting on social media as often because she didn’t “want to be a bummer.”</p><p>Shannen Doherty says that she wants to be positive and be a beacon light for people. She also wants to be someone that people can have an honest conversation with about how hard it is to fight cancer. Or at the very least, Doherty wants to be someone people can relate to.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Doherty concluded that she wants “to be raw and honest” about the experience.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejna6vusSnZJ2nmJq%2FtcWMrqedmaSawG6ywKeqZqeeYrCiusKeqWaakanBrbGMrJiyq12otaa%2FjJuYnKNdlsFutdNmmJ%2Bslad6s7HVnpiloZ6ceqW1wKClqKuZqHp0g5NrcGxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
