A source tells HollywoodLife that Kim would rather take the high road than take the bait, add to the drama and get the rapper more attention.
The Game boasted about having intimate relations with the reality TV star on a track he played at a listening party for his upcoming album titled Born to Rap."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Kim is very classy and, although she doesn’t appreciate The Game rapping about her and her sister, she knows it’s best to not make a bigger deal about it, and she hopes Kanye will do the same.’</p><p>They went on to note that ‘Kim thinks it’s a bit silly that The Game would rap about her all of these years later. She knows how Kanye gets when anyone says anything about her, and it irks Kanye that someone is saying these things, but Kim feels it’s a better look to just ignore it rather than react to it.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Meanwhile, the insider also dished that momager Kris Jenner is ‘all business’ and always tells her daughters to lay low when such things happen.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsSsecqipGajkaexor%2FHopinZZmoeq%2B702anpZmeo7avs4ytpmaqlai9sLrDZquoZaSdsm6zwKacrGWeqLO4ecuyqaKbo2Kuo7vUrWShnaJitaa%2BxKxksKCpYn90hZdwbmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
