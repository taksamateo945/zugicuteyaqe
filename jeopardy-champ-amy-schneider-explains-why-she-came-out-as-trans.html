Some days I feel like I’m 14. As a result of that shift, the types of romantic partnerships I seek out are different,” <strong>Tommy</strong> said in the Time interview. “I was in a nine-year relationship in which I was thought of as a more male-bodied person, with a gay man. I love him so much, but we’ve been learning that as a trans woman, what I’m interested in is not necessarily reflected in a gay man. So we’ve had incredible conversations to redefine our relationship as friends. Transitioning has been liberating and clarifying.”</p><p><strong>Tommy </strong>just made her <a href=#>first public appearance since coming out</a> as a trans woman.</p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmpq8sa3RnbBmm5iWurF5wKawZquTnbumtcOeqWadqKW5orXNrGSwoKliwKmxjJyYpp1dpMK1ecCsZK2qkaPAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
