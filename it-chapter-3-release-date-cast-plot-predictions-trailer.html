Then there is excellent news for you that it will get back soon to hit the screen again as it did in IT chapter 2. If you are one of them who rush to the theatres during the release of its first two chapters, then it will be more frightening for you to watch the next sequel of IT chapters.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you don’t know much about that, let us give you a <a href=#>fresh synopsis of its history</a>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>All IT Chapters are <a href=#>inspired by the novel named</a> by the same name IT, which was <a href=#>written by Stephen King</a> in 1986. Later on, Andy Muschietti directed his first chapter of IT, adapted from the same novel. Lin Pictures, New Line Cinema, <a href=#>Vertigo Entertainment</a>, and Katz Smith Production are the production houses, and <a href=#>WB (Warner Bros) </a>is a distributed owner of all its sequels.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The first <a href=#>two sequels are renowned</a> as the biggest hits in <a href=#>horror genre film</a> categories. That’s why the producers Roy Lee and Dan Lin are all set to invest in its third sequel, i.e. IT Chapter 3. Here we have some specific information about IT chapter three that every IT fan must know about it.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There’s still no official word on when the next chapter will be renewed. Despite that, some internet theories are suggesting that Chapter 3 may be canceled as the <a href=#>novel is fully adapted</a>. However, if the story continues, it would completely alter Stephen King’s <a href=#>original storyline</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 3 Release Date: When will it air?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The creator of IT films, Andy Muschietti <a href=#>hasn’t declared any official release date</a> for its next sequel. Although some internet speculation said that a large part of the story was already covered in the first two chapters, there is not much stuff adapted in chapter 3, so maybe the makers will cancel the plan for this upcoming sequel.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But due to the <a href=#>vast fans’ obsessions</a>, we can expect the third sequel of IT by Warner Bros. The first two chapters of IT premiered on the big screen over a gap of two years, respectively.</span></p><p>In comparison to the first film, the ratings are&nbsp;extremely low. However, it remains to be seen whether the series&nbsp;will be renewed. I’m curious whether <a href=#>there will be a third installment,</a> and if so, when will it be released?</p><p>There is no plan for a new film in the IT franchise because the second installment is the final installment. It’s uncertain when Chapter 3 will be released. However, a film with such a large following will almost certainly receive a sequel.</p><p>Many movie critics predict that the IT Chapter 3 film will be a new season or not. There is officials conformation of making a new series so there is no news on release of third chapter.</p><p>Discover how our favorite show’s second chapter is stacked up in review and rating before <a href=#>diving into the juicy details</a> of season two.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 2 Recap:</h2><p>IT Chapter Two, the 2019 American supernatural horror <a href=#>film directed by Andy Muschietti</a>, takes viewers on a terrifying journey inspired by Stephen King’s 1986 novel. The sequel picks up 27 years after the first film, with the now-adult Losers Club returning to their hometown of Derry to confront their <a href=#>deepest fears and defeat</a> Pennywise once and for all.</p><p>The group must overcome the loss of one of their own as they <a href=#>embark on a dangerous mission</a> to collect tokens from their past and perform a ritual to destroy the malevolent entity. But when the ritual fails, they must band together and use their strength to make Pennywise seem small and vulnerable. In a heart-pounding finale, they succeed in <a href=#>defeating the monster</a> by crushing its heart and saving its hometown from its grasp.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 2 Review:</h2><p>IT Chapter Two garnered <a href=#>mixed reactions from critics</a>, but hold on to your seats because this sequel still delivers on its scares while staying faithful to the source material. With an <a href=#>impressive 62% rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie has been described as “proving bigger doesn’t always mean scarier for horror sequels, but a fine cast and faithful approach to the source material keep this follow-up afloat”.</p><p>IGN raved about the solid performances that bring this saga to an effective conclusion, although they highlighted some pacing issues and sub-standard CGI. Overall, if you’re looking for an engaging horror flick with memorable set-pieces, It Chapter Two is definitely worth the watch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 2 Rating:</h2><p>IT Chapter Two is a twisted tale that not only pushes the boundaries of what’s acceptable but does so with gore, violence, and language so pervasive that it leaves you breathless. With some sexual elements thrown into the mix, you’re in for a ride that will leave you captivated from start to finish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 3 Cast: Who will appear?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, there is no official announcement of the star cast of IT Chapter 3. All we can say the end of chapter two was also the end of all the losers. Hence there is much expected that none of them will be going to reprise their roles. Therefore the only ones we can expect to get back in chapter 3 are <a href=#>Bill Skarsgard</a> (<a href=#>Castle Rock</a>), who acted the part of Pennywise the dancing clown in the previous sequels. It’s not confirmed yet about the storyline, so the star cast’s prediction is so hard to talk about.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 3 Expected Plot: What will happen on it?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The whole plot revolves around the <a href=#>horrifying</a> scenario created by an evil demon, Pennywise, the dancing clown in the house of seven children in Maine. Hence the plot of chapter 3 will be as horrified as the first two chapters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although no one can predict its third sequel plot, the previous chapter ends well between the Losers and Pennywise, and no more story can be covered in chapter 3 of Stephen’s novel IT. But Andy, an IT maker, once stated that IT 3 will be appearing soon with a <a href=#>different terrifying concept</a>. So, it can be said that Pennywise’s <a href=#>origin and more brutal crimes</a> can be depicted in chapter 3 as an expected storyline.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IT Chapter 3 Trailer: When will it be out?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The <a href=#>official trailer</a> of IT Chapter 3 is not out yet. Well, once the trailer of IT Chapter three will be out, we will get back to you <a href=#>with more updates</a>.</span> Here you watch the trailer of IT Chapter 2:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where can I Watch IT Chapter 2?</h2><p>IT Chapter two is available on various streaming platforms like YouTube, <a href=#>Apple TV</a>, and Google Play Movies & TV.
